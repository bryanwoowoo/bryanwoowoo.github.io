    	Two roads diverged in a <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/radiowest/files/styles/medium/public/201511/road_not_taken_.jpg">yellow wood</a>,<br>
		And sorry I could not travel both<br>
		And be one <a href="http://travelseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/traveller.jpg">traveler</a>, long I stood<br>
		And looked down one as far as I could<br>
		To where it <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/fd/cc/8c/fdcc8c87d7484dbbb8ddbd1c714d0f79.jpg">bent</a> in the undergrowth;
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
		And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
		Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
		Though as for that the passing there,<br>
		Had worn them really about the same,
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		And both that morning equally lay<br>
		In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
		Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
		Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
		I doubted if I should ever come back.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
		I took the one less traveled by,<br>
		And that has made all the difference.
