        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br><br><br>
And be one traveler,<br>l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;o&nbsp;o&nbsp;d<br><br><br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the <br>
u<br>
&nbsp;n<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;d<br>
&nbsp;e<br>
r<br>
growth;</p>

        <p>Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br>
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made<br>
all the difference.</p>
